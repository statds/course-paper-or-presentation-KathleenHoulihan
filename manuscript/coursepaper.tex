\begin{abstract}

 At the Summer Olympics in Paris in 2024, ninety-six men and ninety-six women 
 from around the world will compete on various apparatus. Twelve teams of five athletes will be 
 featured in the team events for both men's and women's events. In terms of events, women
 will compete on four apparatus while men will compete on six apparatus. This paper along 
 with my senior honors thesis will focus on the completion of the UCSAS 2024 USOPC Data Challenge. 
 The UCSAS 2024 USOPC Data Challenge tasks individuals with developing an analytics model that
 can be used to identify and compare the expected medal count for the United States male and 
 female artistic gymnasts at the 2024 Summer Olympics in Paris. At the Olympics there are 8 
 medal events for men consisting of team all-around, individual all-around, floor exercise, 
 pommel horse, still rings, vault, parallel bars, and high bar and 6 medal events for the women 
 consisting of team all-around, individual all-around, vault, uneven bars, balance beam, and 
 floor exercise. In this paper, I will identify which five female artistic gymnasts 
 are best suited to be sent to the Paris 2024 Olympics on behalf of the United States in order 
 to maximize the expected medal count. In my full honors thesis, I will use the methods outlined in this 
 paper to identify which five female and male athletes are best suited to be sent to the Paris 2024 
 Olympics on behalf of the United States and I will also calculate the expected medal count.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

The Summer and Winter Olympics are held every four years, traditionally in a unique country and city.
The importance of the Olympics cannot be understated as the games are a symbol of peaceful global 
interaction and give people hope that a better world is possible. For decades, gymnastics  
has been the most watched sport in the Summer Olympics and the United States has been known for bringing gold 
medal-winning gymnasts to compete. In the 2020 Summer Olympics games in Tokyo, the United States 
female artistic gymnastics team took home the gold medal in the Women's All Around, a bronze medal 
in the Women's Balance Beam, a gold medal in the Women's Floor Exercise, a silver medal for the Women's
Team, a bronze medal in the Women's Uneven Bars, and a silver medal in the Women's Vault. 
Noting that the United States was the only country to have a team medal in all six women's artistic gymnastics 
categories, the likely hood of the United States bringing female athletes that will medal in the 2024 
Paris Olympics is very probable. However, in the 2020 Summer Olympic games in Tokyo, the United States 
male artistic gymnastics team did not medal at all. This data challenge not only tasks individuals 
with predicting the expected medal count, but also predicting which athletes the United States will 
and should select to bring to the Paris 2024 Summer Olympics in order to maximize the number of medals 
the Unites States teams win. \\

\\

The challenge of selecting a team of five athletes to represnet the United States at the Paris 2024 Olympics is 
complicated by the layout of the Olympic artictic gymnastics competition. While five athletes compete at the 
Olympic games, all five athletes do not compete on all four female gymnastic apparatuses. For the team all-around 
medal, four athletes compete on all four apparatuses in the qualifying round and the sum of the top three of four scores 
on each apparatus is calculated to determine if the team advances to the team all-around finals. If a team 
is among the top eight teams to advance, scores from the qualifying round are discared and three athletes from each 
team compete on all four apparatuses again and all three scores on each apparatus are summed and compared to that 
of the other teams. In order to be eligible to compete for the individual all-around medal, an athlete must be 
one of the four athletes that competed on all apparatuses in the qualifying round. If an athlete is among the top 
24 athletes to advance to the individual all-around final based on the sum of their scores on each apparatus, 
scores from the qualifying round are discarded and each athlete competes on all four apparatuses again. Despite 
the fact that four athletes compete on all apparatuses in the qualifying round, only two athletes from each country 
are allowed to advance to the individual all-around finals. Additionally, the top eight athletes on each apparatus 
during the qualifying round are able to advance to the finals for that apparatus. Similar to the individual all-around, 
finals, a maximum of two athletes per country can attend the finals for each apparatus. Using this information, I am 
tasked with determining which combination of five female athletes will maximize the number of medals the United 
States female team wins.\\

The rest of this paper is organized as follows. First, I will discuss the literature that is relevant to 
my research in Section~\ref{sec:lit}. Next, I will identify the data that is available in order to complete 
this project in Section~\ref{sec:data}. Then, I will discuss my 
analytical methods to determine the atheltes that should be sent to the Olympics from the United States 
in Section~\ref{sec:meth}. Later, I will present the results of my 
methods in Section~\ref{sec:res}. Lastly, I will discuss the meaning of my results, some challenges, 
and some limitations of this project in Section~\ref{sec:dis}.

\section{Literature Review}
\label{sec:lit}

Currently there is no literature available relevant to predicting gymnastics outcomes at the 2024 
Paris Summer Olympics or at recent olympics. However, there is literature that relates to various aspects of 
the data that will be used to form my predictions. For example, the article "The Prediction of All-Around 
Event Final Score Based On D and E Score Factors In Women's Artistic Gymnastics" aims to determine the 
impact of individual apparatus difficulty and execution scores on overall score. 
Expertise from this article could be useful in allowing us to understand how D and E scores, 
which are available in my data, play an effort in predicting the overall score. Additionally, the paper 
"Performance rating in menâ€™s world elite artistic gymnastics: a status-quo study on scoring 
tendencies at Olympic Games following rule changes" also can play a similar role in predicting overall 
score. This paper's objective is to analyze the effect on elite artistic gymnastics had by the 2006 rule change 
which aimed to reduce the dominance of difficulty while strengthening performance differentiation in 
competition. Notably, the paper found that the rule change resulted in significantly enhanced performance 
differentiation with the execution or E score being the main predictor of the final score as opposed to 
the difficulty or D score. Furthermore, in the article "How Apparatus Difficulty Scores Affect All 
Around Results in Men's Artistic Gymnastics," the authors use regression, cluster, and ANOVA analysis to 
analyze how difficulty scores predict overall score differently across different apparatuses. However, in this 
article the authors found that while difficulty scores may have predictive tendancies for some apparatuses, 
the strength of the prediction varied drastically from apparatus to apparatus, with there being little to no 
predictive ability for some apparatuses. Ultimately, the available literature on predicting artistic 
gymnastic scores seemed generally limited to how we can use the E and D scores provided in the data sets 
to predict overall score, but some aspects of this literature casted doubt on whether E and D scores should be 
used as predictors at all.

\section{Data}
\label{sec:data}

This year, the University of Connecticut Sports Analytic Symposium (UCSAS) and the United States 
Olympic and Paralympic Committee has released a data challenge focused on identifying a group of 
five athletes who will enable the United States Men's and Women's Artistic Gymnastics teams to 
maximize earned medals at the Paris 2024 Summer Olympics. To predict which of the United States 
athletes are most likely to medal on the various apparatuses, I will be using the cleaned data that 
is provided in the UCSAS data challenge that includes data from major domestic and international 
gymnastic competitions from 2022 and 2023. The cleaned data provides the last name, first name, gender, 
country, date, competition, round, location, apparatus, rank, difficulty score, execution score, penalty, 
and overall score of various potential Olympic athletes at various competitions. This data is available, 
public, and already cleaned to be easily loaded into R studio where the majority of the computations 
required of this project will be completed. 
\\
The UCSAS data challenge also provides data from major domestic
and international gymnastic competions from 2017 to 2021 which must be kept separate from the more recent 2022 
and 2023 data due to the fact that the Code of Points scoring system is changed each Olympic cycle. Regardless 
of this fact, the primary data source for this paper will be the data from 2022 and 2023, as time, injuries, 
and other factors can have a large impact on the success of a gymnast, so the greatest predictor
of the Olympic outcomes in 2024 will be the most recent data.
\\
For the purposes of my research design, I limited the data I utilized to only include female United States
gymnasts. Furthermore, I processed the data to remove any scores of zero based on the assumption that these may 
be indicative of missing scores and that instances of these scores are rare. I further justified my decision 
to eliminate scores of zero for the purposes of knowing the true mean scores of each athlete on each 
apparatus for each successful attempt. Additionally, for some athletes and competitions, I found that the vault
apparatus was listed as "VT," "VT1," and "VT2." This discrepancy is due to the fact that athletes are permitted
two attempts on the vault apparatus. In an effort to interpret the data as accurately as possible and avoid having 
multiple statistics for one athlete on the same apparatus, I corrected this discrepancy by merging "VT," "VT1," and 
"VT2" to all be reported at "VT." Also, the data source is flawed as it alternates between reporting athlete names
in upper or lower case letters. In order to correct this, I converted all last names to lower case for consistency 
purposes. Lastly, the data source is inconsistent in the manner that it reports the first names of athletes as certain
athletes are listed using only their first name at some competitions and are listed using their first and middle names 
under the "first name" category for other competitions. In order to resolve this discrepancy, I manually verified that 
any athletes listed under two names were the same person and I further verified that there were no United States female 
athletes with the same last name so that all statistical computations could be completed through grouping by last 
name alone.

\section{Methods}
\label{sec:meth}

The most important task of the larger project involves determining which 5 athletes
should be brought to the 2024 Olympics in order to maximize success. For women, this means determining 
which five athletes stand the greatest chance of winning the gold medal for the women's individual all-around,
team all-around, Balance Beam, Floor Exercise, Uneven Bars, and Vault. 

In order to select the appropriate athletes, I first processed the data as described in Section~\ref{sec:data}.
Then, I calculated and examined the mean and standard deviations of each American female athlete's score 
on each apparatus. I also examined the number of observations for each athlete on each apparatus to familiarize 
myself with which athletes tend to compete at the most competitions and on which apparatuses. Then, I plotted 
the mean versus the standard deviation of the ten athletes with the highest mean scores on each apparatus. 
Using this visual, I created a parameter for each apparatus that uses both mean score and standard 
deviation to identify which athletes are best suited to be considered to compete on behalf of the United 
States on each apparatus. Using this parameter, I identified the "best" five athletes that compete on
each apparatus based on both their success, a high mean score, and their inconsistency, their standard deviation. 

Next, using only the athletes I identified as the "best" on each apparatus using the parameters, 
I calculated the sum of each athletes mean score for each apparatus and the sum of each athlete's standard 
deviation for each apparatus. Similarly to before, I plotted the mean score versus the standard deviation for 
these selected athletes. This plot is intended to represent
the United States' best candidates for earning a gold medal for the individual all-around component of the Olympics.

Then, using the sum of each selected athlete's mean score for each apparatus and the sum of each athlete's standard 
deviation for each apparatus which was previously calculated, I calculated the summed mean score and standard deviation sum 
of every combination of three athletes. Next, I plotted the summed mean score versus the standard deviation for the ten 
athlete combinations with the highest summed mean score. This plot is designed to identify the United States' best 
candidates for the all-around team finals.

Furthermore, using the sum of each selected athlete's mean score for each apparatus and the sum of each athlete's standard 
deviation for each apparatus which was previously calculated, I calculated the summed mean score and standard deviation sum 
of every combination of four athletes. Once again, I plotted the summed mean score versus the standard deviation for the ten 
athlete combinations with the highest summed mean score. This plot is designed to identify the United States' best 
candidates for the all-around team qualifying round.

Finally, in order to build a final team of five, we will manually examine all of the data in an effort to include in 
the final team the best three candidates for the team all-around, the best candidate for the fourth qualifying position, 
the best two candidates for the individual all-around, and the two athletes that are superior on each apparatus.

Tables~\ref{tab:tableBB},~\ref{tab:tableFX},~\ref{tab:tableUB}, and~\ref{tab:tableVT} display the results of 
computing the mean score and standard deviation of each United States female artistic gymnast on balance beam, floor 
exercise, uneven bars, and vault. The tables also include a number of observations column which adds contextual 
value to the standard deviation. In cases where there was only one observation, the standard deviation value is unavailable.
For the purposes of this research, it is reasonable to ignore any athletes who have only competed once on a particular apparatus.

Ultimately, the list of athletes that ranked among the top five United States female athletes includes Biles, 
Mcclain, Lee, Sumanasekera, Blakely, Carey, Jones, Chiles, Wong, Matthews, Lincoln, and Dicello. However, Lee 
only has reported data for two out of four of the female apparatuses so she will not be considered with the other 
eleven athletes for individual or team all-around. Thus, the list of selected athletes that are involved in future 
computations includes Biles, Mcclain, Sumanasekera, Blakely, Carey, Jones, Chiles, Wong, Matthews, Lincoln, 
and Dicello.

\section{Discussion}
\label{sec:dis}

In my preliminary steps, I calculated the mean and standard deviation for every female athlete on each 
apparatus they were reported to have competed on. From these calculations, I decided to cut out most athletes 
by only inspecting athletes that ranked in the top ten by mean score alone for each apparatus. This was a 
reasonable elimination of data as the score values among the top ten candidates varied enough, often by over a 
full point, to justify that athletes that never ranked in the top ten for a particular apparatus are not 
competitive enough to medal at the Olympics.

I later developed a parameter for each apparatus to further reduce the list of athletes to only include athletes 
that rank in the top five for each apparatus. However, I designed the parameters to be dependent on the score 
standard deviation in addition to the mean score. The intent of the paramter is to create a frontier that selects 
athletes that have high mean scores and low standard deviations in order to select athletes that are the most 
successful and consistent. Ultimately, for each apparatus I selcted the five athletes with highest parameter value.

For the blanace beam apparatus, I selected the parameter: mean score minus standard deviation. This parameter 
is very reasonable as it selects athletes with high means and low standard deviations first (Biles then Mcclain 
then Lee) and selects athletes with lower standard deviations when means are similar (Sumanasekera then Blakely).

For the floor exercise apparatus, I selected the parameter: mean score minus standard deviation. This parameter 
is reasonable as well as it selects athletes with high means and low standard deviations first (Biles then Lincoln) 
and selects athletes with lower standard deviations when means are similar (Carey, Dicello, and Chiles). Note, the 
order in which Carey, Dicello, and Chiles "should" be selected is debatable, but it is most important that the 
parameter selected these athletes as opposed to athletes that have similar mean scores but higher standard deviations 
(Jones and Mcclain) or low standard deviations and low low mean scores (Wong).

For the uneven bars apparatus, I selected the parameter: mean score minus half of the standard deviation. 
This parameter is reasonable as well as it selects athletes with extremely high means first (Jones then Biles) and selects 
athletes with lower standard deviations when means are similar (Wong then Matthews then Blakely). 

For the vault apparatus, I selected the parameter: mean score minus half of the standard deviation. 
This parameter is reasonable as well as it selects athletes with extremely high means first (Biles then Carey) and selects 
athletes with lower standard deviations when means are similar (Mcclain then Jones then Chiles). 

Then, I used these candidates in order to determine who is best suited to compete in the all-around events. 
First, I calculted the summed mean score and summed standard deviation for each selected athlete. Looking at the data 
values and plot of these individual all-around candidates, it is very clear that Biles is strong candidate to 
compete for the individual all-around medal. However, it is not clear whether Jones or Mcclain is better suited 
to be the second United States individual all-around candidate.

Then, I used the summed mean score and summed standard deviation for each selected athlete to calculate the 
summed mean score and summed standard deviation for every combination of 
three and four of these selected athletes. Looking at the data values and plot of the combinations of three athletes, 
it is clear that Biles, Jones, and Mcclain are by far the best suited trio to compete for the team all-around medal. 
Additionally, since this data suggests that both Mcclain and Jones should compete in the qualifying round, there 
is no need to select one over the other for the second individual all-around candidate spot as they would both get 
the opportunity to qualify, and their scores at the Olympics will determine which athlete, if either, will qualify 
to attend the individual all-around finals. 

Looking at the data values and plot of the combinations of four athletes, it is not clear whether Chiles, Carey, or 
Blakely is best suited to be the fourth team all-around candidate as their means and standard deviations are very 
similar. However, looking at the individual apparatus events provides justification for who to ultimately select. 
Knowing that two athletes per country can compete for an apparatus medal, it is strategic to try to compose the 
team of the best two United States athletes for each apparatus. Based on the computations and plots, the superior two 
athletes on balance beam are Biles and Mcclain, the superior two athletes on floor exercise are Biles and Lincoln, 
the superior two athletes on uneven bars are Jones and Biles, and the superior two athletes on vault are Biles 
and Carey. Since Lincoln was not among our top candidates for an all-around medal, it would be logical to select her 
as the fifth United States Olympic team member who does not compete in the all-around qualifying round. Additionally, 
since Carey is one of the candidates being considering for the all-around qualifying round and she is one of our superior 
athletes on vault, it is reasonable to also select her to be the final member of the Olympic team. Although, the 
summed combination that included Carey has the lowest mean in comparison to the combinations including Chiles or 
Blakely, the selection of Carey can be further justified by the facts that the summed mean score difference is 
within one point the combination including Carey has the lowest summed standard deviation.

Ultimately, in order to maximize the the number of medals the Unites States female team wins, I would comprise the 
team of the athletes Biles, Jones, Mcclain, Lincoln, and Carey.

One of the most challenging parts of this research is that there are no prior studies that have similar
aims to predict olympic success or candidates to model the design and methods off of. Additionally, 
the data challenge source provides so much information that determining which data is most valuable 
can be challenging. Currently, my model is limited as it does not take into account the 
Execution score, Difficulty score, penalty, or importance of specific competitions or rounds over others. 
Furthermore, another limitation of our model is that we generally tried to avoid selecting athletes that
had very few attempts on a particular apparatus even if their few or singular scores were exceptional. However, 
I ultimately believe that this method still could be very successfull in maximizing success for the United States 
female gymnasts at the Paris 2024 Summer Olympics.
